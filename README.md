# **Visual Analytics of Energy Consumption and Emissions in the Balkans**  

## **Overview**  
This project presents an interactive **visual analytics dashboard** for analyzing **energy consumption trends and greenhouse gas emissions** in Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, and Turkey over the period **2000–2023**. Utilizing **Pandas, Plotly, and Dash**, this study provides an in-depth examination of the transition to renewable energy sources, the relationship between economic activity and emissions, and regional disparities in energy production and sustainability efforts.  

The dashboard enables users to interactively explore energy-related data using **dynamic visualizations**, facilitating a more intuitive understanding of energy consumption patterns, emissions per capita, and the economic impact of energy use in the Balkans.  

## **Objectives**  
- **Analyze** long-term trends in primary energy consumption across multiple countries.  
- **Compare** renewable and non-renewable energy adoption over time.  
- **Assess** the environmental impact of energy production through CO₂ emissions.  
- **Investigate** the relationship between economic development and emissions intensity.  
- **Provide** a data-driven foundation for policy discussions on energy sustainability.  

## **Methodology**  
The project follows a structured analytical approach:  
1. **Data Acquisition**: Energy data sourced from **Our World in Data (OWID)**.  
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaning, structuring, and aggregating datasets using **Pandas**.  
3. **Visualization**: Developing interactive charts with **Plotly** to highlight key trends.  
4. **Dashboard Development**: Implementing a user-friendly interface using **Dash**.  
5. **Insights & Conclusions**: Extracting meaningful findings to inform discussions on energy policies.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) for data manipulation  
- **Plotly & Dash** for interactive data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory analysis  
- **HTML/CSS (Dash framework)** for dashboard customization  

## **Dataset**  
The analysis is based on publicly available energy data from **Our World in Data (OWID)**, covering:  
- **Primary energy consumption** (fossil fuels vs. renewables) from 2000 to 2023  
- **Country-level energy production** and electricity generation  
- **CO₂ emissions per capita** and their relationship to GDP  
- **Comparative energy consumption statistics** for the Balkans  

## **Key Visualizations**  
The dashboard provides multiple interactive components, including:  
- **Line Charts**: Evolution of primary energy consumption (2000–2023).  
- **Pie Charts**: Energy source distribution by country (2022).  
- **Bubble Plots**: Relationship between CO₂ emissions and GDP per capita (2022).  
- **Bar Charts**: Comparison of emissions and electricity generation across countries.
